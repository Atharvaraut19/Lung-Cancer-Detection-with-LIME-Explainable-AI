# Lung Cancer Detection with LIME Explainable AI

This repository contains the implementation of a lung cancer detection system. The project uses deep learning techniques to predict the presence of lung cancer based on a given dataset. The system is built using Python and deployed using Flask, a micro web framework. The application also incorporates LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to provide Explainable AI capabilities, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.

## Overview

Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer. Early detection can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment. This project aims to aid in the early detection of lung cancer by leveraging machine learning models to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of lung cancer. The application is deployed using Flask and provides a web interface for users to input patient data and receive predictions about lung cancer presence.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict lung cancer.
- **User Interface**: A simple web interface for data input and displaying results.
- **Flask Deployment**: The application is deployed using Flask, making it easy to run and maintain.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended with more features such as user authentication, more detailed analysis, and visualization of results.
- **Explainable AI**: Incorporates LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to provide explanations for the model's predictions, enhancing transparency and interpretability.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrunmayee-762004/Lung_Cancer_Detection.git
cd Lung_Cancer_Detection
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

6. Open your web browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the web interface to input patient data. The application will process the data and provide a prediction about the likelihood of lung cancer. Additionally, the LIME Explainable AI feature will provide explanations for the model's predictions, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind the results.
